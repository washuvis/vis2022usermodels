This repository contains the standardized implementations of all 7 user modeling algorithms, along with the ensemble method, the user study data sets and corresponding interaction logs, and analysis scripts for "A Unified Comparison of User Modeling Techniques for Next Interaction Predicition and Exploration Bias."

## Abstract
The visual analytics community has proposed several user modeling algorithms to capture and analyze users' interaction behavior in order to assist users in data exploration and insight generation. For example, some can detect exploration biases while others can predict data points that the user will interact with before that interaction occurs. Researchers believe this collection of algorithms can help create more intelligent visual analytics tools. However, the community lacks a rigorous evaluation and comparison of the existing techniques. As a result, there is limited guidance on which method to use and when. Our paper seeks to fill in this missing gap by comparing and ranking eight (seven previously proposed, and one ensemble) user modeling algorithms based on their performance on a diverse set of four user study datasets. We analyze exploration bias detection, next interaction prediction, and algorithmic complexity, among other measures. Based on our findings, we highlight open challenges and new directions for analyzing user interactions and visualization provenance.
